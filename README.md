# Data-Analysis-of-Biodiversity-in-National-parks

Hello!

My name is Neel Chudasama and this is my project on Data analysis on four national parks in USA - Yellowstone, Great Smoky Mountains, Bryce and Yosemite National park.

In this project, I use python to produce data visualisations and convey findings.  In the jupyter notebook, it contains the analysis along with conclusions and future steps for this project.

The files in this folder are:

observations_csv - This contains data on the number of observations of a specific animal and at what national park.

species_info.csv - This contains data on what type of conservation status the animal has and other names it is referred to as. This data is specific to the the animal. 

biodiversity.ipynb - This notebook contians all the necessary steps I took for my analysis. 

utils.py - This is a utils library imported in my notebook containing all the functions I used to analyse and visualise the data.
