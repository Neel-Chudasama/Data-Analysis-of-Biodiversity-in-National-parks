# Data-Analysis-of-Biodiversity-in-National-parks

Hello!

My name is Neel Chudasama and this is my project on Data analysis on four national parks in USA - Yellowstone, Great Smoky Mountains, Bryce and Yosemite National park.

In this project, I use python to produce data visualisations and convey findings.

The files in this folder are:

1. observations_csv - This contains data on the number of observations of a specific animal and at what national park.
2. species_info.csv - This contains data on what type of conservation status the animal has and other names it is referred to as. This data is specific to the the animal. 
3. biodiversity.ipynb - This notebook contians all the necessary steps I took for my analysis along with conclusions and future steps for this project.
4. utils.py - This is a utils library imported in my notebook containing all the functions I used to analyse and visualise the data.
